## When2Meet Core Features Discussion

A core feature of When2Meet is drag and click timeslots that can mark and unmark availabilties for the individual. Another feature is seeing the group availabilities on the right hand side, with increasing opacity corresponding to more people available at that timeslot. Those two features are the biggest differentiators from Doodle.
